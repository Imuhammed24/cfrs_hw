This file is for Lecture 11. We will learn how to handle files using Python. 
We will open in read and write modes in both standard and binary forms. 
We also will test how often certain occurrences happen in a file. 
We will figure out how many times a word is used from Python and hope we get our test code right.
We will have fun playing with Python and we will be especially happy when we have mastered the language.

If our code is correct it will say we have encountered:
‘we’ - 10 times, (including this one)
‘Python’ -  4 times
‘file’ -  4 times, three times singular and one time plural
